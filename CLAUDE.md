# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this
repository.

Kagami is a mirror server of Maven repositories.

**Build Commands:**

Backend (Spring Boot):
```bash
./mvnw clean spring-javaformat:apply compile                    # Compile application
./mvnw spring-javaformat:apply test                             # Run all tests
./mvnw spring-boot:run                                          # Start backend server (port 8080)
./mvnw spring-boot:build-image                                  # Create Docker image
```

Frontend (React):
```bash
cd ui && npm install                                            # Install dependencies
cd ui && npm run dev                                            # Start development server (port 5173)
```

**Docker:**
- Pre-built image: `ghcr.io/making/kagami:jvm`
- Local build: `./mvnw spring-boot:build-image`
- Environment variable configuration supported

## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Storage Layer** (`am.ik.kagami.storage`)
   - `StorageService` interface: `store()`, `retrieve()`, `delete()`, `list()`, `stat()`, `stats()`
   - `ArtifactLocation` validates paths (rejects `..`, `~`, absolute paths); an empty path is the repository root
   - `StorageEntry` / `StorageStats` records describe listed objects and repository statistics
   - `LocalStorageService` implementation using filesystem, stored at `kagami.storage.path/{repositoryId}/`
   - The only path to stored artifacts; no other package touches the filesystem
   - `StorageServiceContractTest` is the abstract contract every backend test must extend

2. **Repository Management** (`am.ik.kagami.repository`)
   - `RemoteRepositoryService` uses Maven Resolver API for standard artifacts
   - Each fetch resolves into a scratch local repository (temp directory) and streams the result into `StorageService`
   - Falls back to `RestClient` for non-standard files (e.g., maven-metadata.xml)
   - Supports Basic authentication and HTTP proxy configuration

3. **Web Layer** 
   - `ArtifactController` (`am.ik.kagami.artifact.web`) handles artifact GET and DELETE operations
   - `BrowserController` (`am.ik.kagami.browser.web`) provides repository browsing REST API
   - `LoginController` (`am.ik.kagami.browser.web`) serves login page via Mustache template
   - `TokenController` (`am.ik.kagami.token.web`) generates JWT tokens (requires authentication)
   - URL pattern: `/artifacts/{repositoryId}/**` for artifact downloads
   - API endpoints: `/repositories/**` for repository browsing (requires authentication)
   - Returns proper content types based on file extensions

4. **Browser Feature** (`am.ik.kagami.browser`)
   - `BrowserService` provides repository exploration and statistics on top of `StorageService`
   - Repository listing with artifact count, size, and last update timestamps
   - `lastModified` of a directory entry is optional (object storage has no directory timestamp)
   - Directory navigation with breadcrumb support
   - File information with checksums and content types
   - Uses `@JsonInclude(NON_NULL)` to exclude null values from JSON responses

5. **Security Layer** (`am.ik.kagami.config.SecurityConfig`, `am.ik.kagami.token`)
   - Form-based authentication or OIDC/OAuth2 login for web UI access
   - JWT token-based authentication for private repository access
   - `BasicToBearerTokenResolver` resolves the password part of Basic auth as a JWT bearer token (username is ignored)
   - TOKEN generation requires USER role (JWT tokens cannot generate new tokens)
   - CSRF partially disabled for `/artifacts/**` and `/token`, Remember-me enabled for form-based auth
   - Form-based auth: Default user configurable via `spring.security.user.*` properties
   - OIDC auth: Supports multiple identity providers with email-based access control

6. **Frontend UI** (`ui/`)
   - React 18 + TypeScript + Vite for modern development experience
   - Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling with component-based architecture
   - SWR for data fetching and caching
   - React Router v6 for client-side routing
   - Lucide React for consistent iconography
   - Modern, stylish design with hover effects and transitions
   - 401 error handling with login redirection links
   - Token generation page with repository/scope selection

### Configuration

- Properties use Map structure for repositories: `kagami.repositories.{id}.url`
- Supports username/password for Basic auth per repository
- HTTP proxy configurable via `kagami.proxy.*` properties or environment variables (`http_proxy`, `https_proxy`, `no_proxy`, also in upper case)
- Frontend development server proxies `/repositories`, `/artifacts`, `/login` requests to backend at `http://localhost:8080`
- Web UI authentication modes:
  - Simple: `spring.security.user.name/password` (default: demo/demo)
  - OIDC: OAuth2 client configuration with `kagami.authentication.allowed-name-patterns` for access control
- JWT keys: `kagami.jwt.private-key/public-key` for token signing/verification
- Authentication type: `kagami.authentication.type` (SIMPLE or OIDC)

## Design Requirements

- **Package**: `am.ik.kagami` - Main package

## Development Requirements

### Prerequisites

- Java 21+

### Code Standards

- Use builder pattern if the number of arguments is more than two
- Write javadoc and comments in English
- Spring Java Format enforced via Maven plugin
- All code must pass formatting validation before commit
- Use Java 21 compatible features (avoid Java 22+ specific APIs)
- Use modern Java technics as much as possible like Java Records, Pattern Matching, Text Block
  etc ...
- Be sure to avoid circular references between classes and packages.
- Don't use Lombok.
- Don't use Google Guava.

### Spring Specific Rules

- Always use constructor injection for Spring beans. No `@Autowired` required except for test code.
- Use `RestClient` for external API calls. Don't use `RestTemplate`.
- `RestClient` should be used with injected/autoconfigured `RestClient.Builder`.
- Use `JdbcClient` for database operations. Don't use `JdbcTemplate` except for batch update.
- Use `@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false)` for configuration classes to avoid proxying issues.
- Use `@ConfigurationProperties` + Java Records for configuration properties classes. Don't use `@Value` for configuration properties.
- Use `@DefaultValue` for non-null default values in configuration properties classes.

### Package Structure

Package structure should follow the "package by feature" principle, grouping related classes
together. Not by technical layers.

Current package structure:
- `am.ik.kagami` (Backend - Spring Boot)
    - `artifact.web` - Artifact handling web layer
        - `ArtifactController` - REST endpoints for artifact operations
    - `browser` - Repository browsing feature
        - `BrowserService` - Repository exploration and statistics
        - `web.BrowserController` - REST API for repository browsing
    - `proxy` - HTTP proxy settings for outgoing connections
        - `ProxySettings` - Proxy resolution from properties and environment variables
        - `ProxyConfig` - Applies the proxy to the auto-configured HTTP clients
    - `repository` - Remote repository management
        - `RemoteRepositoryService` - Maven Resolver integration
    - `storage` - Storage abstraction layer
        - `StorageService` - Interface (store/retrieve/delete/list/stat/stats)
        - `ArtifactLocation` - Validated repository id + relative path
        - `StorageEntry`, `StorageStats` - Listing and statistics records
        - `LocalStorageService` - Filesystem implementation
    - `config` - Configuration classes (e.g., security, cross-cutting concerns)
        - `SecurityConfig` - Spring Security configuration with form login
    - `token` - JWT token generation and verification
        - `TokenSigner` - JWT signing service
        - `web.TokenController` - Token generation endpoint
        - `web.BasicToBearerTokenResolver` - Resolves Basic auth password as a bearer token
- `ui/` (Frontend - React)
    - `src/components/` - Reusable UI components
        - `ui/` - Basic UI primitives (Button, Card, Alert, etc.)
        - `RepositorySelector` - Repository selection interface
        - `DirectoryBrowser` - File and folder navigation
        - `Breadcrumb` - Navigation breadcrumb
        - `FileInfoModal` - File details modal
    - `src/hooks/` - Custom React hooks for API integration
    - `src/pages/` - Top-level page components
        - `HomePage` - Repository browser main page
        - `TokenPage` - JWT token generation page
    - `src/types/` - TypeScript type definitions
    - `src/utils/` - Utility functions (formatting, styling)
- `src/main/resources/`
    - `templates/login.mustache` - Server-side rendered login page
    - `static/login.css` - Login page styling to match UI design

For DTOs, use inner record classes in the appropriate classes. For example, if you have a
`UserController`, define the request/response class inside that controller class.

`web` package should not be shared across different features. Each feature should have its own `web`
domain objects should be clean and not contain external layers like web or database.

### Testing Strategy

Backend:
- **Unit Tests**: JUnit 5 with AssertJ for service layer testing
- **Integration Tests**: `@SpringBootTest` + Testcontainers for full application context
- **Contract Tests**: `StorageServiceContractTest` is run against every `StorageService` backend
- **E2E Tests**: `BrowserE2ETestBase` drives the built UI with Playwright (Chromium); each backend has a subclass
- **Test Data Management**: Use `@TempDir` for filesystem testing, maintain test independence
- **Test Stability**: All tests must pass consistently; use specific MockMvc expectations
- All tests must pass before completing tasks
- Test coverage includes artifact operations, repository browsing, and API endpoints

Frontend:
- Component-based development with TypeScript for compile-time error detection
- SWR provides built-in error handling and loading states
- Manual testing through development server with backend integration
- Production builds validated through Vite's build process

### After Task completion

- Ensure all code is formatted using `./mvnw spring-javaformat:apply`
- Run full test suite with `./mvnw test`
- For every task, notify that the task is complete and ready for review by the following command:

```
osascript -e 'display notification "<Message Body>" with title "<Message Title>"'
```

## Important Architecture Decisions

1. **Maven Resolver Integration**
   - Maven Resolver resolves into a scratch local repository (temp directory) per fetch, removed afterwards
   - The resolved file is copied into `StorageService`; resolver bookkeeping files never reach the storage
   - A scratch directory per fetch means no shared local-repository locking between requests
   - Non-standard files (like maven-metadata.xml) are fetched via RestClient

2. **Storage Abstraction**
   - `StorageService` is the single path to stored artifacts, so a new backend touches no other package
   - No `Path` / `File` in the interface; `delete` removes everything at or under a location
   - Resource-based retrieval allows flexible implementation

3. **Configuration Design**
   - Map-based repository configuration for better organization
   - Per-repository authentication support
   - Flexible proxy configuration (properties + environment variables)

4. **Browser API Design**
   - REST API follows standard conventions
   - JSON responses exclude null values using `@JsonInclude(NON_NULL)`
   - Directory navigation uses breadcrumb pattern with `parentPath`
   - File information includes size, timestamps, and checksums
   - Comprehensive API documentation provided for frontend implementation
   - All UI endpoints require authentication except `/login`, `/*.css`, `/error`, `/actuator/**`

5. **Security Architecture**
   - Form-based authentication or OIDC/OAuth2 for web UI with session management
   - JWT tokens for programmatic access to private repositories
   - Tokens include username (subject claim) for audit trails
   - Basic auth automatically converted to JWT bearer tokens
   - Token generation requires USER role - JWT tokens cannot generate new tokens
   - CSRF protection partially disabled (`/artifacts/**`, `/token`) to support REST API usage
   - Remember-me functionality for form-based authentication
   - OIDC authentication supports multiple identity providers with email-based access control patterns

6. **Frontend Architecture**
   - Component-based architecture with reusable UI primitives
   - TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
   - SWR for efficient data fetching, caching, and synchronization
   - Tailwind CSS utility classes organized into maintainable components
   - Modern design with gradient accents, subtle shadows, and smooth transitions
   - Responsive design supporting desktop and mobile interfaces
   - 401 error handling with user-friendly login redirection

## important-instruction-reminders

Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files
if explicitly requested by the User.
